Welcome to pylcp!
=================

`pylcp` is a python package meant to help with the calculation of a variety of
interesting quantities in laser cooling physics.  At its heart, it allows for
automatic generation of the optical Bloch equations or some approximation
thereof given a atom or molecule internal Hamiltonian, a set of laser beams, and
a possible magnetic field. If you find `pylcp` useful in your research, please
