Hamiltonian Functions
=====================

Some useful functions for creating various 'generic' Hamiltonians (i.e. useful
for alkali atoms), including their field dependent & independent parts, and
connections between various manifolds.

Other Hamiltonians
------------------

In addition to the Hamiltonians specified here, there are other, more
specialized Hamiltonians for other quantum systems like molecules.
