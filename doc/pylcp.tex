\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
The calculation of various quantities in laser cooling is hard.

Here we introduce a python-based program that computes the movement of atoms or molecules with complex level structures in arbitrary laser fields, magnetic fields.  The program is broken down

\section{Relevant Physics}
Here, we consider the generic problem of coupling multiple ground states to
multiple excited states, as first outlined in Ref.~\cite{Gordon1980} and then
further expanded in Refs.~\cite{Ungar1989,Tarbutt2015,Devlin2016,Devlin2018}.  We label an individual state $\ket{i_j}$, where $i$ is the index of the manifold to which that state belongs and $j$ is the index of the state within that manifold.

The Hamiltonian is given by
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:obe:generic_hamiltonian}
    \hat{H} = \hat{H}_\text{atom} + \hat{H}_\text{field} -
    \hat{\boldsymbol{d}}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{E}} -
    \hat{\mathbf{\mu}}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{B}}.
\end{equation}
The field component of the Hamiltonian is given by
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:obe:field}
    \hat{H}_\text{field} = \int \left(\epsilon_0 \hat{\mathbf{E}} +
    \frac{\hat{\mathbf{B}}}{2}\right)\ dV
\end{equation}
where $\hat{\mathbf{E}}$ is the electric field operator, $\hat{\mathbf{B}}$ is
the magnetic field operator.  Next, we consider the atomic Hamiltonian,
\begin{equation}
    \hat{H}_\text{atom} = \frac{P^2}{2M} + \hat{H}_\text{internal}
\end{equation}
where $\hat{H}_\text{internal}$ describes the internal structure of the atom.

\subsection{Representation of the Hamiltonian}
In {\tt pylcp}, we represent this Hamiltonian as a series of blocks, with each block containing a manifold of states (e.g., Zeeman sub-levels or a manifold of hyperfine states). A completely generic basis set vector can then be written as
\begin{equation}
    \ket{\phi} = \left(\begin{array}{c} \begin{array}{c} \ket{g_1} \\ \vdots \\ \ket{g_{n_g}} \end{array} \\ \begin{array}{c} \ket{e_1} \\ \vdots \\ \ket{e_{n_e}} \end{array} \end{array}\right)\ ,
\end{equation}
where $\ket{g_i}$ are the eigenstates of the ground manifold and $\ket{e_j}$ are
the eigenstates of the excited manifold.  With this basis vector, the term $\boldsymbol{\mu}_l\cdot\mathbf{B}$ is the field dependent term that mixes states within a given manifold $l$ and $\vec{d}_{lm}\cdot\mathbf{E}_{lm}$ is the field dependent term that couples states of different manifolds.  Using labels $i=g,e$ for the two extreme manifolds, the Hamiltonian blocks look like
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:ham_matrix_form}
    H_\text{atom} = \left(
    \begin{array}{ccc}
    (H_g - \boldsymbol{\mu}_g\cdot \mathbf{B}) & \cdots & (\boldsymbol{d}_{ge}\cdot\mathbf{E}_{ge}) \\
    \vdots & \ddots & \vdots  \\
    (\boldsymbol{d}_{ge}^\dagger\cdot\mathbf{E}_{ge}^*) & \cdots & (H_e+\boldsymbol{\mu}_e\cdot \mathbf{B})
    \end{array}\right),
\end{equation}
where each element in the matrix $H_g$, $H_e$, etc. is itself a matrix.  In general, the the electric fields driving transitions between manifolds are distinct, which is why the electric field gains a specific label in Eq.~\ref{eq:ham_matrix_form}.

To specify the problem, the user defines a Hamiltonian like Eq. (5) by providing the requisite $H_0$, $\boldsymbol{\mu}_l$, and $\boldsymbol{d}_{lm}$ and combining them in the {\tt hamiltonian} class.  The class creates and stores the block structure of the Hamiltonian, and also contains methods that are useful for its manipulation.  The vectors $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ and $\boldsymbol{d}$ are represented in spherical polar coordinates, allowing for translation into $\sigma^{\pm}$ circular polarization and $\pi$ polarizations.  For these vectors, we denote the component $q$ as $d^q$.

In its construction, {\tt pylcp} assumes a that the Hamiltonian is written in a co-rotating frame with a frequency close to that of the laser light, with the number of rotating frames equal to $N_m-1$.  The electric field has the form
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{E}_{lm} = \frac{1}{2}\hat{\boldsymbol{\epsilon}}(r, t) E_{lm}(r, t)e^{i\mathbf{k}(r,t)\cdot\mathbf{r}-i \Delta t + \phi(t)}
\end{equation}
where the complex conjugate term is neglected by the rotating wave approximation.  The user specifies all components of the laser field: the polarization vector $\hat{\boldsymbol{\epsilon}}(r, t)$, the amplitude $E_{lm}(r, t)$, the $\mathbf{k}$ vector, the average detuning between the rotating frame and optical frequency $\Delta$,  and any potential phase modulation of the laser beam $\phi(t)$ in the {\tt laserBeam} class.

Finally, the magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ is specified simply as a user-defined function  of space and time.  With all of these components, the optical Bloch equations and/or rate equations can be constructed for a given set of parameters.

\subsection{The optical Bloch equations}
The optical Bloch equations are equations that govern the evolution of the density matrix with the requisite decays.  They are equations that consider the evolution of a given density operator $\rho_{l_im_j} = \ket{l_i}\Bra{m_j}$.  The master equation for their evolution, in the Heisenburg picture, is
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} = -\frac{i}{\hbar}[\rho, H] + \rho\mathcal{L}\rho
\end{equation}
where the $\rho\mathcal{L}\rho$ superoperator takes into account decays.

The package ${\tt pylcp}$ constructs the first term from an arbitrary Hamiltonian (Eq.~\ref{eq:ham_matrix_form}) by directly computing the commutator.  Programmatically, it  represents the full density matrix as a vector represents the complicated temporal evolution as a matrix, with components that depend on $\mathbf{E}_{lm}$ and $\mathbf{B}$.

The decay is calculated in terms of the radiation-reaction approximation.  In practice, this means that the decay rate out of a state $\ket{l_i}$ is
\begin{equation}
    \Gamma_{\ket{l_i}} = \frac{k^3}{3\pi\epsilon_0\hbar}\sum_{m<l}\sum_{j=1}^{n_l}\sum_q \left|\Braket{m_j|d_{lm}^{q}|l_i}\right|^2,
\end{equation}
where $n_m$ is the number of states in the $m$ manifold.  The real component of coherences between manifolds decay as
\begin{equation}
	Re[\dot{\rho}_{l_im_j}] = -\frac{\Gamma_{l_i}+\Gamma_{m_j}}{2}\rho_{l_im_j}\ .
\end{equation}
Likewise, the population operators evolution with decay is given by
\begin{equation}
	\dot{\rho}_{l_il_i} = -\Gamma_l\rho_{l_il_i} + \frac{k^3}{3\pi\epsilon_0\hbar}\sum_{m>l}\sum_{j=1}^{n_m}\sum_q \left|\Braket{l_i|d_{lm}^{q}|m_j}\right|^2 \rho_{m_jm_j}
\end{equation}
Finally, the coherences within a given manifold obey
\begin{equation}
	\dot{\rho}_{l_il_j} = -\Gamma_l\rho_{l_il_j} + \frac{k^3}{3\pi\epsilon_0\hbar}\sum_{m>l}\sum_{n>l}\sum_{k=1}^{n_m}\sum_{l=1}^{n_m}\sum_q \Braket{l_i|d_{lm}^{q}|m_m}\Braket{n_k|d_{lm}^{q}|l_j}\rho_{m_jn_k}
\end{equation}
[FIX indecies]

The particle's semiclassical motion can be calculated through
\begin{equation}
	\ddot{\mathbf{r}} = -\frac{1}{m} \left\{\nabla H\right\} + \mathbf{a} = \frac{1}{m}\left\{\nabla (\mathbf{d} \cdot \mathbf{E} + \mathbf{\mu}\cdot \mathbf{B})\right\} + \mathbf{a}
\end{equation}
where $\ddot{r}$ is the acceleration of the particle, $\mathbf{a}$ is a constant acceleration, and [...].

For {\tt pylcp}, $\hbar=1$ so that angular frequencies and energies are equivalent.  In practice, the user specifies $H_0/\hbar$, rather than $H_0$. 
When forming a complete Hamiltonian using the hamiltonian class, the user has
the ability to set the units by specifying base units of length $x_0$, time
$t_0$, magnetic field $B_0$ and mass $m$.  For $d\cdot E$, there are two properties
to quantify: the asscoiated wavevector $k_{ij}x_0$, important for random forces, 
and the decay rate $\Gamma t_0$.  For the magnetic Hamiltonian, the user has to 
specify the Bohr magneton in their preferred units, $\mu_B B_0/\hbar t_0$, in 
order to determine the preferred units of magnetic field.  By default, a two-manifold system uses units $t_0=1/\Gamma$ and $x_0=1/k$. 

For lasers, we specify everything in terms of the decay rate of the excited state $\Gamma$ and saturation intensity $I_\text{sat}$
\begin{equation}
    I_\text{sat} = \frac{\pi h c \Gamma}{3\lambda^3} = \frac{2\pi^2 \hbar \omega^3 c \Gamma}{3(2\pi)^3 c^3} = \frac{\hbar \omega^3 \Gamma}{12 \pi c^2}
\end{equation}
the result being that the electric field $E_{lm}(r,t) = \sqrt{I/2I_\text{sat}} = \sqrt{\beta/2}$.
Included Hamiltonians normalize each element in the $(d\cdot E)_{ij}$ Hamiltonian
to $\Gamma_{ij}$ so that a laser with $I/I_{sat}=1$ driving the transition
yields a Rabi rate of $\Gamma_{ij}/\sqrt{2}$.  Likewise, included Hamiltonians
also return $\mu$ without the spin, i.e., $\mu = \mu_B \mathbf{F}$, where
$\mathbf{F}$ is some generalized spin operator.


For the force, this leaves one additional unit to specify, the mass.  If the
user specifies the length, time, and magnetic field, then
\begin{equation}
    \frac{x_0}{t_0^2} \ddot{\mathbf{r}}' = \frac{\hbar}{x_0 t_0 m}\left\{ -\nabla' H'\right\} + \frac{x_0}{t_0^2}\mathbf{a}'.
\end{equation}
The default unit selection for a two-manifold system is $t_0=1/\Gamma$ and $x_0=1/k$, which yields for the prefactor $\hbar/x_0 t_0 m = \hbar k \Gamma/m$.   Further taking into account the units on the left hand side we define
\begin{equation}
	\ddot{\mathbf{r}}' = \frac{\hbar t_0}{x_0 m}\left\{ -\nabla' H'\right\} + \mathbf{a}'
\end{equation}
which defines the `dimensionless' mass as $x_0 m/\hbar t_0$.






The optical Bloch equations are symmetric under population exchange, i.e., $\rho_{l_i, m_j} = \rho^*_{m_j, l_i}$.  The package {\tt pylcp} takes advantage of this symmetry to transform the optical Bloch equations into , increasing speed.

\subsection{The Rate Equations}
In order to do a rate equation model, we first consider that we have a set of
eigenstates and that the matrix~\ref{eq:obe:ham_without_fields} is diagonal.  We
follow the construction of the rate equations from Ref.~\cite{Tarbutt2015} and,
to a lesser extent, the Ref.~\cite{Tollett1995}.
In the rate equation model, we consider three things.  The first is the
excitation rate caused by laser $l$
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:lcp:scattering_rate}
    R^l_{ij} = \Gamma \left(\frac{\Omega^l_{ij}}{\Gamma}\right)^2\frac{1}{1 + 4(\Delta - k\cdot v)^2/\Gamma^2},
\end{equation}
and the decay rate out of the excited state $\Gamma$, and the branching ratio,
\begin{equation}
    \Gamma_{e_j,g_i} = \Gamma \frac{\left|d^{(q)}_{ij}\right|^2}{\left(\sum_i \left|d^{(q)}_{ij}\right|^2\right)}.
\end{equation}
In general, we want to solve for $\dot{N}_{g/e,i}$.  We will do this in units of
$\Gamma$.  For the ground states,
\begin{equation}
    \dot{N}_i = -\sum_{jl} R^l_{ij} (N_i - N_j) + \sum \Gamma_{ij}N_j
\end{equation}
and for the excited states,
\begin{equation}
    \dot{N}_j = - \Gamma N_j + \sum_{jl} R^l_{ij} (N_i - N_j)
\end{equation}
We represent the rate equations as a matrix $R$ such that
\begin{equation}
    \dot{N} = R N
\end{equation}
where $N = (N_{g_1},\dots, N_{g_n}, N_{e_1}, \dots, N_{g_n})$.

\subsection{Random Forces}
In both the OBE and

\subsection{Units}
Units in pylcp are determined through the following master evolution equations
for the OBEs:
\begin{eqnarray}
    \dot{\rho} & = & \frac{i}{\hbar}[\rho, H] \\
    \ddot{\mathbf{r}} & = & -\frac{1}{m} \left\{\nabla H\right\} + \mathbf{a} = \frac{1}{m}\left\{\nabla (\mathbf{d} \cdot \mathbf{E} + \mathbf{\mu}\cdot \mathbf{B})\right\} + \mathbf{a}
\end{eqnarray}

\section{Additional details}

\subsection{A word about polarization}
We have thusfar considered the polarization to be contained $E^l_q$.  However,
computing this quantity is not necessarily trivial.  First, one takes the
magnitude out realizing that is related to the intensity, i.e., $E^l_q =
|E|^l\hat{\epsilon}^l_q$.  Second, $\hat{\epsilon}^l_q$ is defined in the
rotational basis of the quantization axis, whereas for an actual laser beam,
the polarization is defined via some other means.

In general, the polarization is a complex-three space vector, which therefore
has 5 independent parameters.  However, because light is a transverse wave and
$\hat{k}$ is defined (with two parameters), that reduces the number of
parameters to three.  We often think about the Poincare sphere or polarization
ellipse at this stage which is defined by only two parameters, but there is a
hidden parameter which is the orientation of the coordinate system in which
the sphere or ellipse is defined.

For the purposes of computation of $\hat{\epsilon}_q\cdot\hat{\epsilon}_l$,
there seems to be multiple ways to define the coordinate system.  Consider, for
example, defining the polarization in terms of right $\epsilon^+$ and left
$\epsilon^-$ polarized light.  Then the most general polarization vector is
$\epsilon_l = a \epsilon^+_l + b \epsilon^-_l$, where $a$ and $b$ are complex
constants and $|a|^2+|b|^2=1$.  There are thus three independent parameters that
specify this polarization.  Note that the phase between $a$ and $b$ determines
the angle in the plane that a linear projection will point and that
$\epsilon^+_l=\sigma^+$ and $\epsilon^-_l=\sigma^-$ if the magnetic field is
parallel to $\hat{k}$.

If $\hat{k}$ is not parallel to the quantization axis, then we need to rotate
one coordinate system (the laser and polarization) into the other (where the
quantization is done).  Imagine that the Euler angles doing the wrapping are
$\alpha$-$\beta$-$\gamma$ in the z-y-z reference.  In this case, the vector is
rotated through a Wigner rotation matrix, whose elements are given by
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{D}^j_{m'm}(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)
    = \Braket{jm'|\mathcal{R}(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)|jm}
    = e^{i m'\alpha} d^j_{m' m}(\beta)e^{-im\gamma}
\end{equation}
where $d^j_{m'm}$ is the small Wigner rotation matrix.  At first glance, the
diagonal nature of matrix for $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ seems to imply that those
angle do not play an important role; all of the relevant physics is simply
related to $\beta$.  Alternatively, this would imply that the phase angle
between the $\sigma^+$ and $\sigma^-$ components of the unrotated light basis.
We can explicitly construct the matrix element, using $d^j_{m'm}$ from Wikipedia
and the relationship $d^j_{m'm} = (-1)^{m-m'}d^j_{mm'} = d^j_{m,m'}$.
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{D} = \left(\begin{array}{ccc}
  \frac{1+\cos\beta}{2}e^{-i\alpha+i\gamma} & \frac{\sin\beta}{\sqrt{2}}e^{-i\alpha} & \frac{1-\cos\beta}{2}e^{-i\alpha-i\gamma} \\
  -\frac{\sin\beta}{\sqrt{2}}e^{i\gamma} & \cos\beta & -\frac{\sin\beta}{\sqrt{2}}e^{-i\gamma} \\
  \frac{1-\cos\beta}{2}e^{i\alpha+i\gamma} & \frac{\sin\beta}{\sqrt{2}} & \frac{1+\cos\beta}{2}e^{i\alpha-i\gamma}
  \end{array}\right)
\end{equation}
This clearly tells a more complicated story.  The simplest observation might  be
that one of the Euler angles does not matter, at least for the rate equation
model.  In that case, we will square each component and the common phase $e^{\pm
i \alpha}$ will drop out.  This makes sense, as the rotation into the quantization
axis should only have two angles, the third being degenerate because it is an
axis not a full 3-D coordinate system.

Consider the final $\pi$ ($m'=0$) component.  An input beam with equal amounts
of $\sigma^+$ and $\sigma^-$  defines linear polarization, and the relative
phase between the two components defines where that points relative to some
other axis, defined by the overall  phase.  If this differential phase is
$\chi$, then the $\pi$ component would be given by
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\epsilon}_l\cdot\hat{\epsilon_0} = -\frac{\sin\beta}{\sqrt{2}}
  \cos(\gamma+\chi).
\end{equation}
This dependence on the phase angle makes intuitive sense.  Consider a
linearly-polarized wave moving in $+\hat{x}$ and magnetic field along $\hat{z}$.
If the phase angle was such that the two circular components added to produce
linear polarization along $\hat{z}$, the polarization would be completely $\pi$.
On the other hand, if the phase angle was such that the linear polarization was
along $\hat{y}$, then in the spherical basis we would have equal amounts of
$\sigma^+$ and $\sigma^-$ light (with a phase angle in between).

None of this gets us closer to the final result, but it is interesting.
